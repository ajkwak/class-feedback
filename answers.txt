REFLECTIONS

I enjoyed this lab.  It took me rather longer than previous labs have, both to
understand and to execute the content of the lab.  It was fun learning android’s
wrapper methods for the SQLite database, although it was also frustrating in
some ways, since I knew exactly what the SQL query or insertion or update
statement needed to be (like when I was upgrading the database to the new
version), but I couldn’t (or rather shouldn’t) write it directly, and so had to
use the android wrapper methods.  Still, all in all, quite fun.

With regard to the createComment() method in CommentDataSource, I really wasn’t
sure how I wanted to implement this.  I could a) query the database to see if a
comment already existed for the given recipient’s email, and if not, then update
the current record for that user with the new comment text, and if so, then add
a record for that user with the new comment text, or b) try to insert the
comment and if the insert failed (i.e. if the insert returned -1) then update
the comment.  I ended up choosing the latter because it required fewer SQL
queries on the database.  I’m really ambivalent as to whether this was the right
decision, since the unsuccessful inserts also generate error messages in the log
(but don’t actually throw exceptions, so don’t cause the program to stop).

TEST CASES

These test cases include images, and so can't be included in this plaintext
